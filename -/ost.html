  This project aims to be the soundtrack to your OS - to make navigating your desktop environment feel like an adventure through a virtual world.

  OSt allows you to pair your audio tracks to the processes running on your computer. When switching to a new window/program/process OSt will seamlessly transition to the track that is paired to the new process.
