<h3>짜 OSt
  <span class="less">
    - A Context Aware Music Player
  </span>
</h3>
<p>
  This project aims to be the soundtrack to your OS - to make navigating your desktop environment feel like an adventure through a virtual world.
</p>
<p>
  Simply put, when you change windows, OSt changes what you're listening to. It allows you to pair audio tracks to the processes running on your computer, then when switching to a new window/program/process OSt will seamlessly transition to the track that is paired to the new process.
</p>
<h3>짜 Features</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Assign multiple tracks to individual processes.</li>
    <li>Variety of playback modes:</li>
    <li class="indent-1">Loop - loop the track until proceses switch with configurable loop start/end points.</li>
    <li class="indent-1">Variety - randomly play tracks assigned to process but don't repeat tracks until all have played.</li>
    <li class="indent-1">Random - randomly play tracks assinged to process with repeats possible.</li>
    <li>Multi-Platform - currently supported in Windows 7+ and OSX</li>
    <li>Extensibility</li>
    <li class="indent-1">The primary OSt component runs as a small http server on your computer allowing for a variety of front-ends to monitor your context. Possible future front-ends include:</li>
    <li class="indent-2">Changing tracks based on what tab you have open in your IDE.</li>
    <li class="indent-2">Changing tracks based on what tab you have focused in your web browser.</li>
  </ul>
